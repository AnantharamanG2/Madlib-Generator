{Person's Name} and {Person's Name} lived in a notorious crackhouse called the {Random Name} dive. one day they were smoking crack when the {City} police burst in toting 9mm {Item (plural)}. they yelled, put your {Body Part} over your heads! one guy in there who was high as a kite said: "why don't you put your {Body Part}, over your head, {Insult}!" the police got really mad and started shooting. they missed and hit the {Noun} and a {Noun}, breaking it into little pieces. it was eerily quiet and all the crackheads had disappeared, so the cops looked around and said, "what the hell ..." after they'd smoked about {Number} rocks they went into the city breaking {Noun (plural)}, looting, yelling, and robbing old ladies' {Noun (plural)}. they were never caught and are said to be living in a {Adjective} new crackhouse in {City}.

last {Holiday}, i happened across my dad searching for his reading glasses while they were already perched atop his {Body Part}, and i thought, "if i didnt know any better i'd say my dad was stoned."  he wasn't of course.  he's just transitioning from middle-aged into senior discount land. but more and more lately my parents have been reminding me of potheads, and it dawned on me...
old people are in essence stoned at all times.
what used to seem like the {Adjective} ravages of age are a lot less alarming if you just imagine the person being high. then it's kinda adorable. hell, i can really relate to my grandparents now.
i too have {Verb} into a room with a purpose, only to find myself standing there at a total loss of what the purpose was.  i constantly forget where i put my {Noun}, or the point of stories i'm telling halfway through. i'll drive well below the speed limit, wondering why everyone else is being so {Adjective}. i've stared at a tree, just enjoying the look of the damn thing. i've definitely gotten obsessed with a particular kind of {Food}, and i love hot baths and {Adjective} tv.

I did a late night {Talent} show in {City} recently and was hungry on my way home. It was 3AM and I was faced with the decision of stopping at an establishment called "Donut Time" at {Street Name} & {Street Name} or baring hunger pains for my {Number} minute drive home to the {Location}. I was tired and not of sound mind when the choice became crystal clear: it was motherf***ing Donut Time.
I parked my car right next to an angry gentleman who was {Adverb} looking back and forth. When I got out of my car, he screamed "what chu want?!" at me, to which I replied: "a donut." He didn't respond to that, which I decided was the best possible outcome for the interaction. 
Two very polite {Adjective} hookers greeted me at the door and asked if I needed anything. I figured using my "donut" answer again might take on a tragically different connotation in this scenario. I said "no thanks" and threw up a little in my mouth.
Once inside, I asked the {Adjective} owner for a bear claw; he gave me a cinnamon roll. I tried to correct him, but he insisted that what he had just bagged up was, in fact, a bear claw. I had 2 thoughts at this point 1) This does not matter, they taste exactly the same, this is not the time or place to have a semantics argument over breakfast pastries... and 2) F*** THIS GUY. He owns an establishment called "DONUT Time" yet has an amateur donut vocabulary? It may be 3AM, but justice does not sleep!
I made it out alive with a {Adjective} bear claw, a second offer for a horrifying threesome with the hookers, and something I can only describe as a "{Adjective} stare-down" from the man standing beside my car. 
Snacks always taste better when you risk your life to obtain them.

I'm a carnivwhore, which is two things: first, it's a pun. But it's also a great way to describe those of us out there who think meat is better than anything else this life has to offer, like {Awesome Thing}, and even the love of the Baby Jesus. Actually, if you sprinkled some Lawry's on the Baby Jesus and set him out in the sun for a bit... then we're talking. 
I love all meats, even {Type of Meat} and {Type of Meat}. But why drive an Escort when you could clog your arteries with the Ferrari of the flesh: bacon. Face it, bacon is at the top of the meat-heap and it always will be, which is why people love putting it in or around anything they can. Those cash-thirsty corporate vampires know that bacon is pure opium to the fat kid masses. And it only takes a few of us chubdumpsters to form a mass.  
Seriously, if you put bacon on something, I will eat that new bacon-infused combination. Think not? Try me, hippie. Burger? Yawn. Shoelaces? Sure. The cat? Now you're talking. And I'm certainly not alone; {City} is absolutely bonkers for bacon. There's the bacon donut at the Nickel Diner, the {Flavor}-bacon lollipop, and don't forget the ubiquitous bacon-wrapped {Food}, the street cart staple of the city. 
Some of you may be asking: why bacon?  My answer is to punch you in your {Body Part} with a fist full of salty pork sides. Hopefully, you'll become so bacon-permeated you'll start to get the picture. Bacon isn't just the answer to the breakfast question, it's the answer to EVERY question. I wrote in 'pork fat' for President, haters.  
Try to think of a product that bacon doesn't make better. Sandwiches? Popcorn? {Food (plural)}? I put three pounds of bacon in my gas tank and my car had a heart attack. At least I know it went out with pride and glory. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with the meat sweats; luckily the shade on my lamp gives off the unmistakably greasy glow of bacon, so I pull off a little slab and settle back into bed.  
Consider all of you Food Network {noun (plural)} on notice as of this writing (except you Paula Deen, you sexy meat maven). You need to get your chubby, old heads together and 'wow' me with a bacon delicacy worthy enough to shorten my life. F*** this lollipop / donut sh*t, I want you to figure out how to get it inside my {Fruit (plural)} or start feeding it to cows to make bacon milk. Until then, I'll be over here downing some meatshakes, waiting for the next big bacon thing. Make it happen.

There comes a time in every man's life when he must decide whether {Adjective}ly discounted consumer electronics are worth getting punched in the {Body Part} for. 
I found myself in this quandary during the final days of Circuit City's going-out-of-business sale. For weeks I'd avoided the madhouse, chuckling at the gullibility of the lemmings who thought they were gouging the store for a 40% discount, when in fact they were getting no better a deal than a typical sale in their weekly flyer. But as each week passed, the yellow sandwich board outside the store rose from 40% to 50%, then 60, 70, 80 and finally 90 friggin' percent. 
As I stepped through the {Adjective} automatic doors, I reasoned that I was paying tribute to a dying store that had provided me with years of electronic gadgetry, and no-questions-asked refunds when the gadgetry invariably found its way into a blender.  
What I entered was not the store I knew, however; it was a bustling, frantic warehouse of {Noun} and despair, the kind of place you'd go to make black market {Noun} deals. Most of the shelves were half empty, and the shelves that were completely bare had been ripped down and marked for sale. What's {Number}% off  something that was never for sale in the first place?
Most items were actually 60 or 70% off, but that didn't stop people from trolling like {Body Part}-seeking zombies, their eyes trained on the unsorted merchandise for that one hidden gem. A line of people stretched through the store to the lone open cash register, the bleary-eyed customers holding an assortment of off-brand {Item (plural)}, open-box {Item (plural)} and Taylor Hicks CDs. It was like the '92 L.A. riots, but with fewer bricks to the head. 
Then I saw it: the unmistakable off-white color of a Wii console tucked discreetly behind a Zune display, where no one would ever look. Sure, I already had a Wii at home, butâ€¦90 friggin' percent! 
I made my way towards the display, but as I reached for it, another shopper snatched up the console. I sized him up; he was about my height and weight, but he stank of desperation and felonies. He looked like he'd been inside for a while; his dilated eyes had adjusted to the dim fluorescent store lighting, and they darted up and down the Wii like a {Animal} trying to make sense of a {Electronic Gadget}. 
Our gazes met. I knew he knew I wanted what he had, and he wanted it all the more. If I walked away empty-handed, I'd be a {Insulting Name} in the eyes of everyone in the joint. If I took the Wii, I'd have to wait in line for half an hour, giving him plenty of time to retaliate.
He gripped the Wii tighter and puffed out his {Body Part}. It was time to act. 
"Is that Taylor Hicks?" I pointed, and when he turned, I knocked the Wii out of his hand, stomped on it and fled, grabbing a small child at 60% off on the way out.
